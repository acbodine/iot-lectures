              IBM Watson™ IoT Platform provides powerful application access to IoT
              devices and data to help you rapidly compose analytics applications,
              visualization dashboards, and mobile IoT apps.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              Watson IoT Platform allows you to perform powerful device management
              operations, and store and access device data, connect a wide variety of
              devices and gateway devices. Watson IoT Platform provides secure
              communication to and from your devices by using MQTT and TLS.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              The Watson IoT Platform communicates with your applications and devices
              by using the WatsonA IoT Platform API and the Watson IoT Platform
              messaging protocol. The Watson IoT Platform dashboard connects as a
              front-end user interface to simplify operations within the platform.
              Device data can be stored or used with analytics solutions.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              Important concepts in the Watson IoT Platform:
              
              ul
                li.fragment Organizations
                  p.
                    When you register with the Watson IoT Platform, you are given an
                    organization ID. Your organization ID is a unique six character
                    identifier for your account. Organizations ensure that your data
                    is only accessible by your devices and applications. After
                    registration, devices and API keys are bound to a single
                    organization. When an application connects to the service by
                    using an API key, it will register to the organization that is
                    associated with the API key that is used.
              
                  p.
                    For your security, it is impossible for cross-organization
                    communication. The only way to transmit data between two
                    organizations is to create an application within each
                    organization that will communicate with applications in the other
                    organization.
              
                li.fragment Devices
                  p.
                    A device can be anything that has a connection to the Internet
                    and that can push data into the cloud. However, devices cannot
                    communicate directly with other devices, instead devices accept
                    commands from applications, and send events to applications.
                    Devices in the Watson IoT Platform are identified by a unique
                    authentication token. Devices must be registered before they can
                    connect to the Watson IoT Platform.
                  p.
                    The Watson IoT Platform recognizes two classes of device; managed
                    devices and unmanaged devices.
              
                li.fragment Managed Devices
                  p.
                    Managed devices are defined as devices that contain a device
                    management agent. A device management agent is a set of logic
                    that allows the device to interact with the Watson IoT Platform
                    Device Management service by using the Device Management Protocol.
                    Managed devices can perform device management operations,
                    including location updates, firmware downloads and updates,
                    reboots, and factory resets.
              
                li.fragment Unmanaged Devices
                  p.
                    Unmanaged devices are all devices without a device management
                    agent. Unmanaged devices can connect to the Watson IoT Platform
                    and send and receive events and commands, but they cannot send
                    device management requests or perform device management
                    operations.
              
                li.fragment Gateways
                  p.
                    Gateways are specialized devices that have the combined
                    capabilities of an application and a device, which allows them to
                    serve as access points for other devices. Devices that cannot
                    connect directly to the Internet can access the Watson IoT
                    Platform service by first connecting to the gateway device.
                  p.
                    Gateways must be registered before they can connect to the
                    service.
              
                li.fragment Applications
                  p.
                    An application is anything that has a connection to the Internet
                    and interacts with data from devices and control the behavior of
                    those devices. Applications identify themselves with the Watson
                    IoT Platform by using an API key and a unique application ID.
                    Unlike devices, individual applications do not need to register
                    before they can connect to the Watson IoT Platform. However, they
                    must use a valid API key that has been previously registered.
              
                li.fragment Events
                  p.
                    Events are the mechanism by which devices publish data to the
                    Watson IoT Platform. Devices control the content of their
                    messages, and assign a name for each event that is sent. The
                    Watson IoT Platform uses the credentials that are attached to
                    each event received to determine which device sent the event.
                    This architecture prevents devices from impersonating one another.
                  p.
                    Applications can process events in real time, and see the source
                    of the event and the data contained in the event. Applications
                    must be configured to define which devices and events they
                    subscribe to.
              
                li.fragment Commands
                  p.
                    Events are the mechanism by which devices publish data to the
                    Watson IoT Platform. Devices control the content of their
                    messages, and assign a name for each event that is sent. The

                    of the event and the data contained in the event. Applications
                    must be configured to define which devices and events they
                    subscribe to.

              The IoT for Insurance components work together as described in this
              section. This organization is also shown in the architecture diagram.
              The IoT for Insurance dashboard displays data stored in the Watson IoT
              Platform and in the IBM® Cloudant® NoSQL DB for Bluemix® database. The
              user's smart devices can be connected either through the cloud or
              directly to the Watson IoT Platform. If they are connected through the
              cloud, they send data to the Transformer, which processes the data and
              sends it onto the Watson IoT Platform. Data from Weather Company Data
              for IBM® Bluemix® can also be pulled into the IoT for Insurance Weather
              Company Data Transformer and from there into Watson IoT Platform. The
              data is processed by the shield engine, which generates a shield event
              and sends it through APIs to the Action Engine. The Action Engine can
              optionally use IBM® Push Notifications for Bluemix® to send
              notifications to the user's mobile application. The user can also use
              the mobile application to respond to alerts or offers.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: Earlier versions of IoT for Insurance used the IBM® Mobile Client
              Access for Bluemix® service to process the responses and return them
              through the APIs to Watson IoT Platform and then to the IoT for
              Insurance dashboard. This process continues to work for instances of
              the early versions of IoT for Insurance. However, new instances of IoT
              for Insurance do not include Mobile Client Access or Push Notifications.
              To use the mobile app, you must create a custom authentication process.
              You can also optionally create and bind an instance of Push
              Notifications to the API to enable push notifications.

              <li class="fragment">Insurance dashboard
                <p>
                  The Insurance Dashboard gives insurance company users, such as

                  insured assets. They can see the shields and events at a country,

                  The REST APIs are used by the mobile starter app, the insurance
                  dashboard, the shield engine, and the hazard controller. They
                  enable users to know the associations that exist between devices
                  and shields and actions. By using the APIs, programmers can create
                  new users, generate event data, create and register new shields,

                  The Weather Company application injects relevant weather data from
                  the Weather Company Data Service into the IoT4I data stream.
                  This data can then be used to build weather enabled shields.

                <p>
                  Based on the information that is stored in an event, the Shield
                  engine determines if a hazard such as a water leak occurred. If a
                  hazard is identified, it is passed to the Action Engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A shield is a specific protection that a customer acquires from the
                  insurance provider. For example, a homeowner purchases insurance on
                  their home to shield it against fire, water damage, burglaries, and
                  other hazards. The IoT for Insurance solution provides a built-in
                  shield against water. Customers are alerted and can respond when an
                  event that involves water threatens their home. Using the REST API,
                  developers can add more shields.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Shields run in the IoT for Insurance analytics engine. The
                  analytics engine identifies the type of hazard (for example, Water
                  is detected), the user account of the sensor that sent the hazard,
                  and the shields that are associated with the account. Action can be
                  taken based on that information. You can use or modify the shields
                  that are included in the IoT for Insurance shields library or you
                  can create and implement your own shields. For more information
                  about shields and the IoT for Insurance shields library , see the
                  Shield toolkit.

                  The Action engine determines the actions to take based on the
